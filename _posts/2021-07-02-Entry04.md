This week I finished Section II.  I picked up where I left off ensuring the reader had a thorough introduction the MySQL Workbench’s menus and layouts.  Using clearly worded instructions and screenshots to mirror their own view of the program.  This process was somewhat time consuming because MySQL Workbench’s interface only partially mirrors that of Microsoft Access, so to some extent I have to make my own decisions about what information is relevant to include in the tutorial and what isn’t.  The final portion of section II centered around the Northwind database as an introductory database to load and handle within the program.  Within Microsoft Access this database is included by default.  But in the case of MySQL Workbench I had to track down two freely available scripts on the internet, one to build the database and one to stock it with data.  I then had to rigorously check that there were no errors or flaws with the scripts I was using.  The section concludes with a basic explanation of saving, loading, and deleting databases.
