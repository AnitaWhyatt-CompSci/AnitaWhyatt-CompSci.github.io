This was my first week with access to a work computer so I began my work with section I: Course Preparation.  This section was fairly straightforward.  As it familiarizes the reader with the layout of the book, various learning objectives, database terms, and other miscellaneous introductory material.  Updating this section was a fairly straightforward process as there are not many tutorials or references that need to be redone.  I also got acquainted with my co-worker “Cathy” this week who I will be partnering with on this project.  Her job will be to take my re-written section text files, diagrams, and screenshots, and format them into the correct graphical format in a pdf document.  Cathy seems like a very upbeat person and I look forward to working with her.
