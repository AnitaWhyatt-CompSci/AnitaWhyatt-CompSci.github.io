This was the second week spent working on Section IV.  Or now that I had thoroughly reacquainted myself with proper query writing in the SQL language, my first week actually working on the text for section IV.  I spent the week carefully crafting tutorials for each statement type and scenario, complete with plenty of screenshots to enable the user to follow along.  Primarily this was a tedious process more that an intellectually challenging one, as each screenshot needs to be captured, cropped, labeled, and saved. The of course referenced in the text accompanied by an explanation of is being done and why.  I expect to spend one more week on this section before I am done, it will be no doubt the longest section in the book both in terms of time spent on it and overall page count.
