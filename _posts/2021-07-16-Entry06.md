title: Entry 06

I finished Section III this week.  As you read in the previous entry, section III centers around tables and the second half of this section is designed to guide the reader through creating their own tables using the software.  Recreating the tutorials was more a tedious process then it was a mentally challenging one.  The original text guides the reader through the process of making an example school database which tracks information about students and the classes they enroll in.  I re-did this tutorial but will all the instructions, descriptions, and screenshots re-created specifically for MySQL Workbench.  This process consumed some time but for the most part was fairly easy.  At the end of this week I had finished section III and had a little time left over so I spent some re-familiarizing myself with writing queries in the SQL language, which is the subject of the next section.  I am most excited for the next section as SQL query construction is one of my favorite things about working in SQL.
