For my third week I began tackling the second section entitled “Database Fundamentals”.  This section was a little more complex then the first section.  It begins with an overview of database components and history.  Most of this explanation can be carried over without many alterations.  But next the section introduces Microsoft Access starting with an installation guide and progressing into a basic tutorial of the layout, and finally introducing the concept of creating, saving, and opening databases with our first sample database.  The ‘Northwind’ database.  As it turns out re-writing a textbook properly is slightly more challenging that I expected.  It took me awhile to re-write the installation instructions to account for a number of difficulties that the user could potentially encounter and to ensure every small step included screenshots to maximize the ease of understanding.  By the end of the week, I was done with the installation guide and was partially done with the tutorial introducing the reader to MySQL Workbench’s general layout.
