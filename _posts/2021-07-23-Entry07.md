This week marked my beginning on what I expect to be the longest section in the book, Section IV. Section IV dealts with querying datbases for their information. In MySQL Workbench this means writing complex queries in the SQL language. I took a class in SQL databases previously, but I still had to spend this week primarily reviewing what I know about SQL query composition.  Retrieving data from a single table involves the use of things like the SELECT Statement, the WHERE clause, operators like AND, OR, NOT, IN, and BETWEEN, and also LIKE.  It was important I do a thorough review on the nuances of their use. Retrieving data from multiple tables involves employing the use of different join statements, such as inner joins, outer joins, and cross joins. Once i had done a through review of the implementation I was able to spend the last part of the week getting started on the text writing itself.
