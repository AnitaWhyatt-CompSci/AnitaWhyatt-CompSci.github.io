My first and primary project at Marcraft industries will be updating an educational book produced by their company entitled “The Complete Introductory Database Course” originally published in 2005.  This book uses the now mostly outdated Microsoft Access as it’s teaching software the students are meant to follow along with.  My first task was to examine the contents of the book and decide on a more appropriate and currently relevant database software to redo the textbooks tutorials in.  I compiled a list of half a dozen or so programs listing their pros and cons and presented it to my supervisor Chuck.  This list included such programs as SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.  After some discussion we ultimately decided on MySQL Workbench, the freely available community edition being something I myself have experience working with.  For the first week I lacked a work computer to work on, so my job was to analyses a printed copy of the textbook and get a feel for its layout.  The book consists of nine sections titled as follows: Course Preparation, Database Fundamentals, Tables, Information Retrieval, Forms And Reports, Advanced Database Features, Database Administration And Security, Design Briefs, and Knowledge Transfer Review.  The finals section being a sort of checklist for the student to keep track of what they have successfully learned.
