For this week I began Section III “Tables”.  This section can best be describes as split into two parts.  The first part a conceptual explanation of tables, how they organize data, and how they function within a larger database.  The second part then giving a detailed hands on walkthrough of how to build and manipulate tables with the program.  It should be noted that this section does not relate to querying tables for information which will be covered in the next section.  This week was spent on the first part that involved an explanation of what tables were, there different relationship types, and how Entity Relationship Diagrams could be used to represent this information.  A lot of the textbooks original explanations can simply be carried over as theses ideas have not changed much since 2005, and I reused several of the ERD diagram examples.  However I inevitably found myself making minute changes here and there as I polished the layout of what was already a fairly well put together document.
